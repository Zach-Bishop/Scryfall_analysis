This program will take a set of queries written in a JSON file and output a CSV file with all of the cards that match the queries in the sets.

Queries should be written like 'Wilhelt_Counterspell': 'ci:UB o:/counter target.*spell/' this will make a column named Wilhelt and in the cell for any card which matches the given condition will be string that says Counterspell.
